[논문검색식 작업 안내문]

1. scopus.kisti.re.kr 에 로그인
 - www.scopus.com 은 검색엔진이 다르므로 활용하면 안됨. 

2. 검색식 작업 팁
 - Advanced Search 에서 검색
 - 주로 and , or 연산자를 활용하여 검색식을 작성하며 영어로 작성함. 
 - 검색식에서 wildcard (*, ?) 는 적용한 검색엔진에서 안먹히는 경우가 있어서 가능한 사용하지 말라고 함.
 - 발행년도: PY=(2015-2020)   최근 6년 
 - 해외 정부 투자 과제 검색도 논문 검색식을 활용함. 
 - 실제 데이터 다운로드는 개발자와 협의하여 일괄 다운로드 받는 것으로 계약되어 있으나 개발자가 검색식의 오류까지 검토하지는 않으므로 오류없는 검색식을 제출해야 함.
 - 검색식을 엑셀로 저장하는 과정에서 큰따옴표의 모양이 이상하게 변경되는 경우가 있어서 엑셀양식을 버리고 텍스트 양식을 선택하게 되었음. 
 
3. 제출 내용
 - 중분류 코드, 검색식, 검색건수   : 코드별 검색식과 검색건수도 제출해야 실제로 개발자가 다운로드한 건수와 비교해서 정확도를 점검할 수 있음.
 - 텍스트 에디터 (울트라에디터, Notepad++ 등) SW에서 작성하여 제출 (*.txt 파일로)

4. 개발자가 다운로드해서 주는 파일의 명칭 형식 :   정밀의료_T01.txt
